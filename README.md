# Chatpack updater

This is a small hash-based updater for [chatpack](https://github.com/chatmud/chatpack), which uses it's git repository when checking for updates.
This means no external web apps that keep track of versions are needed, and the manifest (a file describing the hashes for everything under the chatpack directory) can be automatically updated when people commit.
